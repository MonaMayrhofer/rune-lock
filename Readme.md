# Rune Lock Solver
This is a program to solve and explore "Rune Circle Locks" which are a fictional type of magic lock within my Pathfinder Table Top Roleplaying World.

Currently the lock itself is hardcoded - but can be changed in `main.rs` and there are several commands to steer the solver into the right direction, which are documented in `command.rs`

If anyone besides me actually wants to use this stuff, please contact me via issues or something and I will bring this into a state that is useful.
